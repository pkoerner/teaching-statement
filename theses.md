# Theses

This section should help you with

- getting an idea what the process of writing a thesis is,
- getting an idea what a thesis can be about,
- finding some examples of prior theses I advised.

## Theses I Advised

At the HHU, we have three types of theses.

1. The bachelor's thesis (Bachelorarbeit).
   Here, you are expected to work on a topic on your own for a longer timeframe (3 months) 
   and to describe your work and results in a written form.
2. The project (Projektarbeit). 
   Typically, two semesters during your master's studies, you work on some projects (about 600 hours).
   As the project itself does not require you to have (positive) results, 
   it can be used to explore whether a topic is suitable for a master's thesis.
   A written report is not required and there is no official registration.
3. The master's thesis (Masterarbeit).
   Similar to the bachelor's thesis, but the timeframe is longer (6 months)
   and it is expected that you demonstrate your ability to do scientific work.

## The Process of a Thesis

Your thesis will begin some time before you officially register it 
and you are expected to present your work after handing in the written part.

1. First contact:
   Feel free to approach me if you want me to advise your bachelor's thesis.
   Keep in mind though that I cannot supervise too many theses at the same time.
   Thus, sadly, I must filter potential theses by my own interests,
   available time and your individual strengths.
   
   At this stage, we can chat and brainstorm about your skills (typically the modules you have taken)
   and interests, and what might be suitable topics for you.
   It will benefit greatly if you have taken a look at theses that I already advised
   and my research activities to see what might interest you.
   I try to give you some ideas that can take my research further [here](topics.md)

   For most of the topics based on my own research,
   you will benefit if you know Prolog (see Introduction to Logic Programming),
   Model Checking and/or the B-method (Safety-Critical Systems).

2. Shaping the topic:
   During our first contact, we might agree on some vague idea.
   In the next weeks, you should do some research, [think about the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)
   and write a precise problem statement ([Exposé](https://stups.pages.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/abschlussarbeiten/offene-themen/betreuungsleitfaden/expose.html)).
   This is an iterative process that will help to ensure that we agree on basic terms, concepts and the goals of your thesis.
   Thus, expect to make improvements after I give you feedback on your exposé multiple times.

3. The actual thesis:
   Once you have written your exposé and you have developed a proper understanding of the topic,
   and have planned some ideas and some (hopefully realistic) schedule, you are allowed to officially register the thesis.
   Approval typically takes a few days.
   From then on, the clock is ticking.
   Keep in mind to consider alternatives and do your research on related work early.
   Also write down ideas and results as you implement.

   Some techniques presented in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTtnx1AAJ-c) might be useful for your thesis.
   For example, it is helpful to keep track of a precise glossary (so you are forced to use precise terminology and are less likely to make up your own terms),
   to keep track of your actual problems (and not features) and to document the choices you made for what reason and alternatives.

4. The defense:
   After your thesis, you must present your work and results.
   You should create a presentation (and do not scroll through your thesis) and, depending on your topic,
   might do a tool demonstration.
   The presentation of a bachelor's thesis should take 15-20 minutes, a master's thesis is worth spending 20-30 minutes.
   Be prepared to answer questions about your work.
